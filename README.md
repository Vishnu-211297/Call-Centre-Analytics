PWC Power BI Virtual work experience - Forage

This repository contains the Power BI dashboard project that analyzes and visualizes customer support call data. The dashboard focuses on key performance metrics for customer service agents, such as call volume, resolution rates, response times, and customer satisfaction.

This dashboard allows supervisors to track agent performance and customer satisfaction over time. It can be further customized for deeper analysis or used to benchmark agents against key performance indicators (KPIs).
